*Historical Immersion Project: Commons*

This is the HIP Commons component for Crusader Kings II's Historical Immersion Project. It's intended to be installed by the HIP installer in most HIP component selections and provides *critical* common module files. Eventually the sarcasm may be wiped from the prior sentence completely.
